# Anti_Spoofing
Face recognition apps are vulnerable to presentation attacks like digital displays or printed paper. This necessitates robust deep learning models for face anti-spoofing to ensure authenticity.

# Face Anti-Spoofing for Enhanced Biometric Security

This project uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) to perform real-time face detection.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed Python 3.6 or later.
- You have installed the following Python libraries: `cv2`, `cvzone`, `ultralytics`.
- You have a Windows/Linux/Mac machine.

## Installing Face Detection with YOLO

To install Face Detection with YOLO, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Fenil2511/Anti_Spoofing.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Anti_spoofing
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Using Face Detection with YOLO

To use Face Detection with YOLO, follow these steps:

1. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python yoloTest.py
    ```
2. The script will open your webcam and start detecting faces in real-time.
